        programme hosted by Taberah Glory Camp for over 25 years
        now. <br> In Promotion Retreat God comes to his people
        in a spectacular way, and he sends his word through his
        servants to heal them, deliver them, promote them 
        and most of all give them a bigger and better
        understanding of who they are in the spirit realm 
        and the change they can make on earth.

                In 2019 God came and he gave us one word <b> "OBEDIENCE"</b>
                that was the theme of that years retreat, the year after he told us
                <b>"we are the light of the world"</b> but he did not stop there, in that
                year's retreat he gave us  an instruction to <i>obey</i> he said to us 
                <i>"Let your light shine..."</i> so we used what we learnt in 
                2019 to practice the message of 2020. But God did not stop there, he went ahead
                in 2021 and said <b>"REIGN ON EARTH"</b>. He said now that we are light it will be
                easy for us to reign, because we are in such a dark world and light will
                always rule over darkness. Now God has come to us in 2022 and he has said <b>"The Manifold Wisdom of God"</b> 
                he has come again this year to tell us another way to reign over principalities and power.
                God has come to clearly say that his plan for our lives is that we will be teachers, who will teach principalities and
                powers, the manifold wisdom of God (Ephesians 3:10).
